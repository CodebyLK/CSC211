## 2. Program Details

### Module 1

#### hello.txt  
This is a simple test program that prints hello.  

#### RandNum.java 
This is a random number guessing game. First, the Random class is used to generate a random number between 1 and 10. The user is then prompted to guess the correct number and is given up to five guesses. Feedback is provided to the user throughout the course of the game in the form of "Too high" or "Too low." Finally, upon conclusion of the game the player is given the opportunity to either play again or end the game.  

### Module 2

#### BankApp.java
This program simulates a bank with methods for both deposits and withdrawals. It contains an array of doubles that keeps track of all deposits and withdrawals. The user can make deposits into the account and withdrawals from the account. At the conclusion of the transaction a receipt is printed with a list of all transactions along with the account balance.  

### Module 3

#### Automobile.java
This automobile program demonstrates inheritance. It has an Automobile superclass with methods for accelerate, decelerate, honk, reverse, forward and stop. It also demonstrates the compareTo and equals methods. The program has three subclasses (Car, SportsCar and JunkCar) that extend the superclass. Each subclass includes methods that override the superclass. The main method instantiates an object for each of the subclasses and an array is created to hold each object and demonstrate the methods.
